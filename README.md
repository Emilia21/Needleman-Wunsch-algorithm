# Needleman-Wunsch-algorithm
Implementing and executing+ application for alignment of a given pair of genetic sequences according to the Needleman - Wunch algorithm.

# Sequence Alignment
Sequence Alignment is a process of aligning two sequences to achieve maximum levels of
identity between them. This help to derive functional, structural and evolutionary relationships
between them.
Aligning sequences assigns functions to the unknown proteins, determines the evolutionary
relatedness of organisms and helps in making prediction about the 3D structures.
Homology is attributed to similarity due to a descent from a common ancestor, i.e. if two
sequences from different organism are similar there is a possibility that both sequences are
termed as Homologous. Thereby, predicting structure and function for the sequences.

# Global sequence Alignment 
In this alignment sequences are aligned along their entire
length to include as many matching characters possible.
<br />
Seq 1 - TAGC-GC-GT
<br />
Seq 2 - TA-CA-CAGT

### the application expects the two sequences to be given as a console input on two separate lines;
